This is the preserved mummy of King Tutankhamun, discovered in 1922 by archaeologist Howard Carter in the Valley of the Kings.
Tutankhamun ruled Egypt during the 18th dynasty, becoming pharaoh at a very young age.
His tomb was found almost completely intact, filled with treasures, artifacts, and his golden burial mask.
The discovery of his mummy provided historians with a rare opportunity to study the burial practices of Ancient Egypt.
The body showed signs of injuries and diseases, leading to many theories about his early death.
Despite dying young, Tutankhamun left behind a legacy that continues to fascinate the world today.
His mummy represents not just a young king, but a symbol of the rich and mysterious Egyptian civilization.
Modern scientific studies, including CT scans and DNA tests, have revealed important details about his life and health.
Tutankhamun’s mummy remains one of the most iconic archaeological discoveries in history.
Today, it rests inside his tomb (KV62) in the Valley of the Kings, protected and preserved for future generations.
